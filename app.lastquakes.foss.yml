Description: |-
  LastQuakes is a comprehensive application providing real-time global earthquake monitoring with multi-source data integration, interactive map visualization, and advanced filtering capabilities.

  '''Core Features:'''

  * '''Multi-Source Data Integration:'''
    * USGS (U.S. Geological Survey): Comprehensive global earthquake data
    * EMSC (European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre): Enhanced coverage for European and Mediterranean regions
    * Intelligent deduplication: Automatic removal of duplicate events from multiple sources
    * Optimized caching with offline access support

  * '''Interactive Map Visualization:'''
    * High-performance map rendering with smooth panning and zooming
    * Multiple base layers: Street Map, Satellite Imagery, Terrain View, Dark Theme
    * Magnitude-based markers with color-coding and size scaling
    * Marker clustering for better visualization at different zoom levels
    * Optional tectonic plate boundary visualization
    * Real-time filtering by magnitude, time window, and distance

  * '''Dynamic List View:'''
    * Filter by magnitude threshold, country/region, and distance
    * Distance calculation with unit preferences (km/mi)
    * Sort by time, magnitude, or distance
    * Modern card-based design with gradient headers
    * Lazy loading with efficient list rendering

  * '''Detailed Event Analysis:'''
    * Comprehensive information including magnitude, depth, coordinates
    * Tsunami warning status and distance from user's location
    * Source attribution (USGS/EMSC)
    * Interactive map pinpointing event location
    * Share functionality for social media and messaging apps

  * '''User Preferences:'''
    * Theme settings: Light Mode, Dark Mode, System Default
    * Unit preferences: Kilometers or Miles
    * Time format: 12-hour or 24-hour display
    * Data source selection: Enable/disable USGS and EMSC
    * Persistent storage for settings

  * '''Statistics & Analytics:'''
    * Visual representation of seismic activity trends
    * Magnitude and geographic distribution charts
    * Time-based analysis: hourly, daily, and weekly patterns

  * '''Privacy & Security:'''
    * F-Droid version is completely open-source with NO proprietary dependencies
    * No user tracking or data collection

  '''Note:''' This is an independent project and is not officially affiliated with USGS, EMSC, or any government seismological organization.

  '''FOSS Build:''' This F-Droid version excludes all proprietary Google services (Firebase, Play Services) and uses only open-source alternatives.
